# Config file for py-gpgdir.
#
# Set the key to use to encrypt files with "use_key=<key>", e.g.
# "use_key=D4696445".  See "gpg --list-keys" for a list of keys on your
# GnuPG key ring.  Alternatively, if you want gpgdir to always use the
# default key that is defined by the "default-key" variable in
# ~/.gnupg/options, then uncomment the "default_key" line below.

[DEFAULT]
# Uncomment to use the GnuPG default key defined in ~/.gnupg/options:
DefaultKey=no

# If you want to use a specific GnuPG key, Uncomment the next line and
# replace "KEYID" with your real key id:
UseKey=KEYID
